               <p>I am 23 years old and graduated from India.
                  <br> I have been in IT field since 2016. Initially, i was a commerce student.
                  But i was not much keen into that field, studying commerce was like we can say peer pressure for me. 
                  <br> Fortunately, soon i realised that i belong to technical sector...means i have always enjoyed working on computer.
                  So, i decided to do graduation in computer application and continue further study in IT as well.
